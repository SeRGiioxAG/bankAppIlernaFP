# bankAppIlernaFP:
_Simple console bank app made with Java (JDK 13) for my FP assignment._

I got a *10* in the evaluation. It was a *strict one* because we had to create specific classes, with specific functions and arguments. That's why everything is in spanish.

You can see the document with the instructions to create this in the repository. It's called PAC_DESARROLLO_M03.pdf (in spanish)
